// Peer reviewed by: Caroline Hana 3/17/2023 - I like how you did the services it made the code a lot cleaner and minimal so it was easier to read and explained the logic more. The background was funky but everything else looked great. The colors were right and the slider also had the linear background. The dark and light also worked well. Great job!

import Home from "./components/home/Home";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Home />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
